Jurassic Park: The Game Asset Reader
=============================
This simple WPF application can load asset files from Telltale Games' Jurassic Park: The Game title from 2011. 
The application was built solely for educational purposes and out of personal (and obsessive) interest, I can't (and won't) guarantee everything works perfectly.

One last thing - please buy the game, it's amazing!

Features:
* Simple GUI with only one button
* D3DMeshes are exported into Wavefront OBJ (supported in Blender, Unity3D, 3ds Max and Maya)
* Automatically creates materials for the different textures, with the texture name as the material name
* Scene files are merged into a single *.obj file, including group transforms (EXPERIMENTAL)
